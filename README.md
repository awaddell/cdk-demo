# A Demo AWS CDK app

## Intro

The AWS CDK has just gone GA and, in order to demo standing up a 3-tier architecture in AWS, what better way than to write infrastructure-as-code in real code with, in my case, Typescript.


## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
